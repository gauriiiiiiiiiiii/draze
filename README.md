# 🎨 DRAZE

> **Where Shapes Take Form**

---

## 🌟 Overview

Draze is a cross-platform, interactive geometric drawing application that empowers users to visualize, draw, and manipulate a wide variety of geometric figures. Draze is unique in that it offers both a modern web-based interface (built with React) and a native desktop experience (built with C/GTK), sharing a common design language and feature set. It is designed for students, educators, engineers, and anyone interested in geometry or visual mathematics.

---

## 🚀 Motivation & Vision

- **Bridging the gap** between educational geometry tools and modern UI/UX standards.
- **Making geometry accessible, beautiful, and interactive** for everyone.
- Inspired by the lack of intuitive, cross-platform tools for geometric visualization.
- Created to be both an educational resource and a practical tool for geometric exploration.

## ** Project Overview & High-Level Design**

**Q1: Can you give me a quick overview of Draze?** </br>
**A:** Draze is a cross-platform geometric drawing application that allows users to visualize, draw, and manipulate a variety of geometric shapes. It has two implementations: a modern React-based web app and a native desktop version built in C with GTK and Cairo. Both share the same design language, feature set, and workflow, so users get a consistent experience whether they’re on the web or desktop. It’s aimed at students, educators, engineers, and anyone interested in visualizing geometry in an interactive way.

---

**Q2: Why did you decide to build both a web and a native version?**</br>
**A:** The motivation was twofold: </br>

1. **Accessibility** – The web version makes it easy for anyone to try the tool instantly without installation. </br>
2. **Performance and offline capability** – The native version provides lower-latency drawing, integrates with the OS, and works without internet access.
   Additionally, implementing both pushed me to design modular code and think carefully about how to translate features across very different tech stacks.

---

**Q3: How do the web and native versions maintain feature parity?** </br>
**A:** I used a **mirroring approach** to feature development. For every feature on the web, I designed an equivalent GTK implementation in C. Both use a similar mental model — a shape stack, undo/redo operations, and a modular UI — which makes it easier to keep them in sync.

---

## **Frontend (React) Specific** 

**Q4: How is drawing handled in the web version?** </br>
**A:** The web version uses the **HTML5 Canvas API** for drawing. React manages UI state — like selected shape, color, and line width — while actual rendering is done imperatively on the canvas to avoid unnecessary DOM updates. State changes trigger a redraw of all shapes in memory, ensuring consistency even after undo/redo.

---

**Q5: Why not use SVG instead of Canvas?** </br>
**A:** SVG excels for DOM-based graphics with many individual elements, but in Draze, users can draw hundreds of shapes and curves interactively. Canvas offers better performance for rapid, continuous rendering, especially for complex curves like epicycloids and spirals.

---

**Q6: How do you implement undo/redo in the React version?** </br>
**A:** I maintain two arrays: </br>
* `undoStack` for all drawn figures </br>
* `redoStack` for figures removed during undo </br>
  When a shape is drawn, it’s pushed onto the undo stack. Undo pops from undoStack to redoStack; redo pops back. Each operation triggers a full canvas redraw from the current undoStack contents. </br>

---

## **Native (C/GTK) Specific**

**Q7: How is drawing implemented in the native version?** </br>
**A:** Drawing is handled with the **Cairo graphics library** inside GTK’s drawing area widget. Each shape has its own drawing function that takes parameters (like center, radius, color). All shapes are stored in a linked list (`FigureStack`), which is iterated over during redraws.

---

**Q8: Can you explain your memory management strategy in C?**
**A:** Every shape node in the linked list is dynamically allocated. On deletion (undo/redo or clear), memory is freed immediately to avoid leaks. On exit, I traverse the list and free all nodes. I also check allocation return values and print errors to `stderr` if needed.

---

**Q9: How are undo/redo stacks implemented in C?** </br>
**A:** They’re implemented as linked lists for O(1) push/pop. The `undoStack` list contains currently drawn figures, and `redoStack` contains figures undone. Redoing moves a node back from redoStack to undoStack.

---

## **Cross-Platform & Architecture**

**Q10: What are the biggest differences between implementing Draze in React vs. C/GTK?** </br>
**A:** </br>
* **Rendering model**: React is declarative and uses Canvas API; GTK+Cairo is imperative. </br>
* **Memory management**: Automatic in JS, manual in C. </br>
* **UI composition**: React has reusable components; GTK uses widgets and signals. </br>
* **State management**: Hooks in React vs. manual structs in C. </br>
  These differences affected how I designed the core drawing logic for each platform.

---

**Q11: How did you ensure performance stays smooth with many shapes?** </br>
**A:** </br>
* Optimized redraws to only happen when state changes. </br>
* Used lightweight data structures (arrays in JS, linked lists in C). </br>
* Avoided storing unnecessary intermediate states. </br>
* Precomputed math-heavy curves like cycloids before drawing, instead of recalculating on every frame. </br>
 
---

## **Mathematical & Algorithmic**

**Q12: How do you draw complex curves like cycloids or spirals?** </br>
**A:** These are drawn using their parametric equations. For example, a cycloid is defined by: 

```
x = r(t - sin(t))
y = r(1 - cos(t))
```

I iterate over `t` in small steps, compute `(x, y)` for each, and draw connected line segments. Step size is tuned for smoothness vs. performance.

---

**Q13: What’s the time complexity for a redraw?** </br>
**A:** O(n) for n figures, since each redraw involves iterating through the list/array of figures and re-rendering them.

---

## **Testing & Reliability**

**Q14: How did you test Draze?** </br>
**A:** Testing was mostly manual, focusing on: </br>
* Drawing correctness (shape dimensions and coordinates) </br>
* Undo/redo correctness </br>
* Cross-browser and cross-platform consistency </br>
  For web, automated tests could be added with Jest/React Testing Library; for native, unit tests could be built with GLib’s test framework.

---

**Q15: How do you handle invalid inputs?** </br>
**A:** All coordinate and parameter inputs are validated before being used. In JS, I check types and ranges; in C, I validate input before processing to avoid undefined behavior.

---

## **Future & Improvements**

**Q16: What features would you like to add next?** </br>
**A:** </br>
* Save/load drawings (JSON or SVG) </br>
* Export to vector formats (SVG/PDF) </br>
* Collaborative web mode </br>
* More shape types (Bezier curves, polygons) </br>
* Automated test coverage  </br>

---

**Q17: How would you add collaborative drawing in the web version?** </br>
**A:** I’d use WebSockets or WebRTC for real-time updates, with a shared state model stored on a backend server. Changes would be diffed and broadcasted to all clients.
